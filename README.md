# Welcome to the KayLab Repo

In here are scripts that I have developed relating to my current projects. 
If you have any question, feel free to comment or email me.

## Real-time_SQWV_peak_height_analysis_KL_GOQ_CHI_version.py 
This script allows for real-time analysis and plotting of square wave voltammograms primarily used for the electrochemical aptamer-based sensors developed by the Plaxco Lab.
This particular script is for datafiles generated by the CH instruments potentiostats. 

## Real-time_SQWV_peak_height_analysis_KL_GOQ_Palmsense_version.py 
This script performs the same analysis as the above script. This particular script is for datafiles generated by the Palmsense instruments potentiostats.
